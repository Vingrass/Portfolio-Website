            I do not have a project to put here yet, other wise this would be a description of the project below a
            picture/video of the project in use, and possibly a download button for said project. Instead here is a 
            picture of my friend Jacob, he wanted to be included in this because I would interupt his league of legends
            games to talk about HTML and CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am also re-using the style sheet because I do not want to make a new CSS file for a place holder.
