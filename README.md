# Website Portfolio
### Made by Vincent Ingrassia

This is a project I made for my UCSD code boot camp. It is an website designed to act as
a portfolio of my works. At the current date: (6/25/23) I only have one project to display.
However the criteria for this assignment requires three, so there is a temporary place holder
being linked until I have more projects to display.

The project contains three sections, one to display information about myself.
Another to display images of my projects/applications and link to them.
Lastly a section to show how to get into contact with me.
Each of these sections can be quickly scrolled to by clicking on their title
in the navigation menu in the header.

This was written in html lang english, with the UTF-8 charset.
